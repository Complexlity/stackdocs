# Who Can Contribute

All stackies are free to contribute to the project in any way including opening an issue, requesting a feature, fixing a bug, adding a feature, adding new campaigns and quests on the page, updating the docs etc,

# How To Update Quest and Campaign Documentation

At the moment, All Campaign and Quest pages contain a `Brief Overview Here` text. This is a dummy text which represents a simple summary of what the StackUp Campaign or Quest Teaches.

At the base of the campaign page, you would see and button `edit this page`.

This takes you to the exact file to edit the document in the repo. Make the updates and pull a request

Optionally, you could navigate to the [docs](/docs/) folder and find the folder for the quest and update it

**IMPORTANT!!**: Ensure the `Brief Overview` is indeed brief(3 lines at most). The main purpose of StackDocs is to provide links to the particular stackup page

# How To Create A New Campaign Or Quest On The Docs

For now, I will be adding all new campaigns and quest but I intend to provide a well detailed guide so anyone would be able do the same with ease
