# Token Standards Masterclass - ERC721

In this second campaign of our three-part series, you'll explore ERC721 token standards, learn how they differ from ERC20 tokens, and gain practical experience by creating and deploying your own ERC721 smart contract and NFT assets while understanding the relationship between token URI, metadata, and asset data.
