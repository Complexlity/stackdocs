# Creating an NFT Fullstack Dapp

In this campaign, you will learn how to create your own NFT minting fullstack dApp using Hardhat, Solidity, Web3.js, and React. You will start by creating images and uploading them, along with their metadata, to IPFS. Then, you will create and deploy an ERC721 smart contract to the Polygon Mumbai testnet. Finally, you will build a frontend interface for users to mint NFTs. By the end of the campaign, you will have the skills to create a complete NFT project
