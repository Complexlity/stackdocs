# ERC20 Fundamentals

In this quest, we will explore ERC20 tokens and their technical components. We'll cover the mandatory functions and events in an ERC20 smart contract, create and deploy our own ERC20 token, and customize the functionality of existing ERC20 contracts. By the end, you'll be proficient in working with ERC20 tokens.

:::tip Happy Learning!!
