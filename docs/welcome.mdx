# Welcome To StackDocs

StackDocs is designed to help you quickly traverse campaigns and quests on the [StackUp](https://app.stackup.dev/) . StackDocs provides you with direct links to the specific pages you are looking for, saving you some time.
Think of StackDocs as a centralized hub that acts as a compass to help you navigate through the vast terrain of information on StackUp. Just as a compass points you in the right direction and guides you to your destination, helping you find what you're looking for with ease.

## Motivation

If you're like me, who revisits and references the excellent resources provided by the StackUp team in quests and campaigns, you would notice that finding past campaigns/quests takes a lot of scrolling and clicking. Worse comes when you're not sure what campaign a particular quest is "Is it python for beginners? or pandas for python? or python for data science?" and you have to send as many server requests to find what you're looking for.
This happened to me so often, I decided to find a way around it. And here we are

## Future Plans

For now, there's no telling if this would get any traction or not. But these are the short and long-term goals for the site (In no specific order)

- Make the repository open source (Create the necessary README files for consistent structure and guidance for the package)
- Complete the search feature. This may require the paid algolia options
- Update all `Brief Overview Goes Here` dummy text in the documentation to give some description to the quest and campaigns
- Continuous update from stackup
- Continue Building..... (Who knows, maybe this will be the new stackup community guide ðŸ˜€)
