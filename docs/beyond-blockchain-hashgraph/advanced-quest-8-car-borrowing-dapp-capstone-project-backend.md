# (Advanced) Quest 8 - Car Borrowing DApp Capstone Project (Backend)

In this quest, we'll build a Car Borrowing DApp using skills learned in previous quests and incorporating all functionalities offered by the Hedera Network Services. We'll focus on building the backend of the project and explore using MetaMask in Hedera development, learning to create fungible token and NFT collections, mint NFTs, and transfer fungible tokens and NFTs using a Solidity smart contract. We'll also integrate MetaMask wallet with Hedera testnet and deploy and interact with smart contracts

:::tip Happy Learning!!
