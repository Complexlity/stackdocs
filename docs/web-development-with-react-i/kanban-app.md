# Kanban App

In this quest, we'll create a Kanban web application to organize tasks. Users can move task cards between buckets (To Do, In Progress, Completed) to track their progress. We'll use React Draggable for drag-and-drop functionality and store data in local storage using the useEffect hook. By the end, you'll perform CRUD operations on cards and build a functional Kanban app.

:::tip Happy Learning!!
