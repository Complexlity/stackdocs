# Foundry for Web3 Development

In this campaign, we'll explore Foundry, a web3 development framework written in Rust. It provides tools for developing and deploying smart contracts on EVM compatible blockchains. By the end, you'll be able to implement, test, debug, and deploy smart contracts using Foundry, and generate gas reports. No prior Solidity knowledge is required. Let's get started with Foundry!
