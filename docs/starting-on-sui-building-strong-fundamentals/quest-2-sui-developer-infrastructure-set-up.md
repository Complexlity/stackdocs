# Quest 2 - Sui Developer Infrastructure Set Up

In this quest, we'll prepare our local development environment for Sui and dive into the Sui CLI (Command Line Interface). We'll focus on network and account management using the Sui CLI and learn how to integrate the Sui Wallet by importing accounts created with the Sui CLI, setting the stage for further exploration of the Sui ecosystem in upcoming quests.

:::tip Happy Learning!!
