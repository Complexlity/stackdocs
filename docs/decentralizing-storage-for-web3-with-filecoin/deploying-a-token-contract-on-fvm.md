# Deploying a Token Contract on FVM

In this quest, you'll learn about the Filecoin virtual machine (FVM) and how it enables developers to build EVM-compatible smart contracts and dApps on the Filecoin network. You'll also deploy a token contract on the FVM using the Hardhat framework to the Hyperspace testnet, and gain the ability to differentiate between FVM and FEVM
